# Educate-Backend

This code is for the backend of my final year university project called "Educate". The project's aim is to redesign the popular education management platform BlackBoard Learn to make the new experience more modern, user oriented, intuitive, integrated and more productive for both teachers and students alike.

### Features
The code here contains the MVP of the platform, which includes: 

- Instructors can create, update and delete course material with support for multiple file types and icons.
- Instructors can create, update, delete, and grade course assignments with the ability to attach files.
- Students can view active assignments and submit their solutions with the ability to attach files.
- Users can navigate through the course material in a way similar to file explorers on modern Operating Systems and download them.

Future plans include:
- Adding a live video chat option with live text chat to conduct course sessions on the platform.
- Adding a messaging option where instructors and students can communicate on the platform.
- Adding an option to create questionnaires on the platform to host exams with the option of automatic grading.

### New Things I Learned
- Using trees to create a file hierarchy structure and implement an OS like file explorer. The structure allows for deep nesting with the ability to add, download and remove files and folders.
